# Data Structures: List as abstract data type

## List as abstract data type

### List :
1. Store a given number of elements of a given data type.
1. We should be able to 'write/modify' any element at any position int the list
1. Read element at any position.

###  We are talking about **arrays**.
  ```c
  int A[0];
  ```
  ```c
  A[i] = 2;
  ```
  ```c
  print A[i];
  ```
